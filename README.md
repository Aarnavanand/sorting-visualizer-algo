# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a simple visualization tool for common sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort. It allows you to input an array of numbers and watch the sorting process unfold step-by-step.

## Features

* **Visual Representation:** 
    * Each number in the array is represented by a bar with height proportional to its value.
    * The bars change color during the sorting process to highlight comparisons and swaps.
* **Algorithm Selection:** 
    * Choose from four popular sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.
* **Array Input:** 
    * Enter an array of numbers manually or generate a random array.
* **Step-by-Step Execution:** 
    * Control the sorting process by stepping through each iteration.
* **Speed Control:** 
    * Adjust the speed of the visualization.

## Technologies Used

* **React:** For building the user interface and managing the application's state.
* **JavaScript:** For implementing the sorting algorithms and handling user interactions.
* **CSS/Tailwind:** For styling the visual representation of the array.
